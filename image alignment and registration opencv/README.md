### Image alignment and registration with OpenCV

Image alignment and registration have a number of practical, real-world use cases, including:

#### Medical: 
MRI scans, SPECT scans, and other medical scans produce multiple images. To help doctors and physicians better interpret these scans, image registration can be used to align multiple images together and overlay them on top of each other. From there the doctor can read the results and provide a more accurate diagnosis.

#### Military: 
Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) algorithms accept multiple input images of the target, align them, and refine their internal parameters to improve target recognition.

#### Optical Character Recognition (OCR): 
Image alignment (often called document alignment in the context of OCR) can be used to build automatic form, invoice, or receipt scanners. We first align the input image to a template of the document we want to scan. From there OCR algorithms can read the text from each individual field.
