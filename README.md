# ocr-opencv-python-tutorials
Summarizing my self-learned tutorials in the topic of building OCR applications.

I tried out the following tutorials from several blogs. 

- ocr-with-tesseract is the tutorial from [nanonets blog](https://nanonets.com/blog/.) 
- ocr_docker is an example of building a simple OCR web app with docker. [Source](https://github.com/ricktorzynski/ocr-tesseract-docker/blob/master/README.md)
