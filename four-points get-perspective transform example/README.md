### 4 Point OpenCV getPerspective Transform Example

Automatically finding the corners for the transform
In order to obtain our top-down transform of our input image we had to manually supply/hardcode the input top-left, top-right, bottom-right, and bottom-left coordinates.

That raises the question:

Is there a way to automatically obtain these coordinates?
